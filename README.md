# Developmet

We offer several example programs for developers to publish their own contracts, deploy tokens, and provide mining programs. The code is in `publish.ts` and `mint.ts`. You need to understand the code and write your own program logic. Feel free to follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/NoteProtocol) and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tGBHKDPkF5) to interact with other builders.


## Publish Smart Contract
```
publish [contract name]
```

## Deploy Token
```
deploy
```

## Mint Token
```
mint
```

### Test Case

Switch to the testnet

```
use BTCtestnet
```

Use the `info` command to get the main address, then obtain test tokens via the faucet.

```
info
```

#### Testnet4 Faucet

and send them to the main address. Finally, you can try using the `mint` command
```
mint
```

# Notice
Please thoroughly test on the testnet before deploying to the mainnet. No one is responsible for the accuracy of protocols, indexers, or contract codes, nor does anyone guarantee the value of assets. Write smart contracts entirely at your own risk.
